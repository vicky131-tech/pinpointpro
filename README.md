# 📌 PinPoint Pro

> **The Open-Source "Invincible UI" Window Manager & Productivity Surface.**

PinPoint Pro is a high-performance, context-aware digital workspace designed for deep work. It transforms your browser or desktop environment into a "pinned" productivity surface, using AI to intelligently manage window layouts, categorise research, and provide semantic search across your entire workspace.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🪟 Advanced Window Management
- **Smart Pinning**: Pin any window to stay on top of your workflow.
- **Ghosting Mode**: Inactive pinned windows become translucent and grayscale, reducing peripheral distractions while maintaining visibility.
- **Desktop Folders**: Drag and drop windows onto each other to create smart stacks and categorised folders.
- **Multi-Tab Surfaces**: Browser windows feature a deeply integrated tab architecture, allowing multiple web resources to coexist in a single pinned surface.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Intelligence
PinPoint Pro is designed to work with **any AI provider**. We recommend [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) as the preferred provider, but you can plug in any OpenAI-compatible API.

- **Ghost Search (⌘K)**: A semantic search engine that understands the *content* of your open windows. Ask "Find that research about LLMs," and PinPoint Pro will highlight the relevant window.
- **Tab Ingestion**: The Smart Assistant can "sync" your external browser tabs, summarising them and arranging them into logical workspace layouts.
- **Layout Orchestration**: Use natural language to tell the Assistant how you want to work (e.g., "Set up my screen for a deep coding session").

### 🧘 Focus & Zen
- **Focus Timer**: Built-in Pomodoro cycles with "Focus" and "Break" modes.
- **Aura Pulse**: Pinned windows pulse softly with your accent colour when the focus timer is active.
- **Zen Mode**: One-click UI dimming that fades out non-essential windows, leaving only your pinned focus tasks visible.
- **Focus Soundscapes**: Procedural ambient noise (Nature, Lo-Fi, Deep Ambient) to drown out distractions.

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: "The Invincible UI"

PinPoint Pro follows the **Invincible UI** framework:
- **Glassmorphism**: High-blur, translucent surfaces that maintain spatial awareness of the background.
- **Mesh Gradients**: Procedural, flowing backgrounds that shift based on your active "Colour Theme" (Nebula, Sunrise, Ocean, Emerald).
- **Responsive Motion**: 0.4s cubic-bezier transitions for all window movements, ensuring the interface feels organic and lightweight.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 (ES6 Modules)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI Engine**: Provider-agnostic — bring your own API key. Recommended: [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service)
- **Icons/Graphics**: Custom CSS Glassmorphism + Lucide-inspired iconography.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- An API key from your chosen AI provider. We recommend **Azure OpenAI** — sign up at [azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service).
- A modern browser with ES6 module support (such as the latest versions of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari).

### Supported AI Providers
PinPoint Pro works with any OpenAI-compatible API. Set the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `API_KEY` | Your AI provider API key |
| `API_BASE_URL` | API base URL (optional — defaults to Azure OpenAI endpoint) |
| `API_MODEL` | Model name (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`) |

**Recommended (Azure OpenAI):**
```env
API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key_here
API_BASE_URL=https://YOUR_RESOURCE.openai.azure.com/
API_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

**Other compatible providers** (any OpenAI-compatible API):
```env
API_KEY=your_key_here
API_BASE_URL=https://api.your-provider.com/v1
API_MODEL=your-model-name
